"""
Creates a dictionary of haiku poems from text file.
Haiku keys are just numbered indexes.
Each haiku is also a dictionary with fields:
    - lines
    - tokenized_lines
    - pos_tags
    - syllable_counts
    - genotype_form


Argument 'file_name' is the name of the 
txt file with existing haiku poems.

Argument 'output_file_name' is the name
of the output json file.

Argument 'write' determines if a json file is written.

Each line of txt file must have exactly one
line of haiku. There must also be an empty 
line between the last line of a haiku and 
the first line of another haiku.

example usage: json_from_text("famous_haiku_poems.txt", True, "fhpj.json")
