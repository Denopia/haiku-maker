The wren
Earns his living
Noiselessly.

From time to time
The clouds give rest
To the moon-beholders.

Over-ripe sushi,
The Master
Is full of regret.

Consider me
As one who loved poetry
And persimmons.

In the cicada's cry
No sign can foretell
How soon it must die.

Blowing from the west
Fallen leaves gather
In the east.

Winter seclusion -
Listening, that evening,
To the rain in the mountain.

Don’t weep, insects –
Lovers, stars themselves,
Must part.

My life, -
How much more of it remains?
The night is brief.

An old silent pond...
A frog jumps into the pond,
splash! Silence again.

I kill an ant
and realize my three children
have been watching.

Over the wintry
forest, winds howl in rage
with no leaves to blow.

Sparrow's child
out of the way, out of the way!
the stallion's coming through

Toward those short trees
We saw a hawk descending
On a day in spring.

No one travels
Along this way but I,
This autumn evening.

In the twilight rain
these brilliant-hued hibiscus -
A lovely sunset

First autumn morning
the mirror I stare into
shows my father's face.

The lamp once out
Cool stars enter
The window frame.
